(Mathematical point of view - AdvancedBetCalc.com Blog)

&#39;ll get to the point immediately, so that you don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been insincere in a title.
The truth is: You can be successful, but you probably won&#39;t
That is the reason why gambling causes addiction. If a player is winning then people call him a
professional, but when he&#39;s losing, then they call him an addict. I have never heard that
someone is called an addict, if he was making a good living out of it. Gambling is a big problem
when people lose money and perpetually do it again and again... leading themselves to waste,
and destroying their lives and lives of their loved ones. On the other hand, if they make a good
money out of it, they are considered to be smart and if they spent all day doing it, then they are
&quot;hard working people&quot;.
This will not be a story about addiction, although I sincerely hope that it will open eyes of those
among us, who maybe have addiction problems ...but were in lack of information, necessary to
recognize it. They have my sympathy, as they have my best wishes in finding true fortune in life,
far from the world of gambling..

Here is though, how you can be successful:
First the obviously - you need to start picking winners more often then chances predict the
average player will do.
Actually, you can guess like the average player does, but then the odds must be greater than
they should be - according to its real chances (that is known as &quot;value bet&quot;).
The second thing is the amount of the money that you have invested on a bet. This thing is so
important that you can pick winners very badly, but if you invest good - you can be successful.
How? It is simple. Invest ten times $1 on losers and just one time $100 on a winner :), a joke, but
you get the point.
Third is the system you choose for your picks to play in. Appropriate one can bring hundred
times more gain than the badly chosen one, in the long term.

And here is why you probably won&#39;t be successful:
You probably won&#39;t pick winners better than the average player does.
You almost definitely won&#39;t invest appropriately (when multiple choice comes in a game).
And if you maybe know how to calculate first two things, the third (choosing a system), you&#39;ll
most definitely fail to do properly, not because you aren&#39;t smart enough, but because of its great
time consumption - it&#39;s just too much for anyone except for profesional gamblers.

Picking
There are two right ways you can do this.
If you are absolutely sure that you know the outcome (I won&#39;t even try to guess how anybody
could do that), then the odds are no subject in the matter.
And, secondly, if you can tell with certainty that the odds given by bookies are too big for real
chances for that occurrence to take the place. (value bets)

Invest amount
This would be so simple if only we could say with certainty what were the real chances for our
pick to be successful. Then we could use Kelly&#39;s criterion. Sadly, we have to stretch those
chances from minimum to maximum - and go with minimum.
By doing that, we will fail to achieve maximum profit, but we will do good enough, anyway.

System
Here we have similar problem as in invest amount, but now things go multidimensional.
That is why we made this calculator and surely gave some advantage to players.
The problem is that playing one by one (singles) - in a case when starting time of games does
not overlap - is the best way to maximize your profit. But if you want to play a few games
simultaneously (for diversification purpose, or value bet games, and they do start at the same
time) then you have to calculate in wich system will you be able to achieve the maximum that
you would otherwise achieve by playing singles (that were to play one after the other).


A mathematical theory is not to be considered complete
until you have made it so clear that you can explain it to
the first man whom you meet on the streat.

The goal

I would like to talk about serious betting and the way that the true gambler approaches to it.
The way he chooses invest amounts (whether he chooses Kelly&#39;s criterion or something else..),
or the most profitable system to extract maximum money (doubles or trebles or..).
For those among us, to whom the first choice in life was not mathematical education, I would like
to say: do not have fear of the subject, because I will talk about it in simple tongue, with purpose
of lifting up our awareness on what kind of approach to betting is right and what is not.
So all &quot;scientific stuff&quot; will be said in the way that 6th grader could understand.
Ok, first for all of you who are not really sure what Kelly&#39;s criterion is, or maybe haven´t heard of
it at all, here´s the explanation:
Imagine that you are playing a game of coin tossing and every time you guess the outcome -
you get $1.10 profit, but if you miss - you lose $1.00 (Of course no one will give you that deal,
but we are using it to show the point). So, if you play that game for 200 tossing and guess 100
times and miss 100 times, you will have 100 x 1.10 = +$110.00 and 100 x (-1.00) = -$100.00,
that means you´ll have +$10.00 on your balance. Nothing new here yet.
The question is can we extract more from that? Well, we can try investing $5.00 instead $1.00 -then we
would earn $5.50 when we guess and lose $5.00 when we miss.
Using the same logic we could try investing more money, so why not try all $200.00 of our Bank, but who can
guarantee that you won´t miss the first one and go broke.

The question that we must ask ourselves is: can we calculate the best amount so we can extract
maximum money, that is through this situation, offered to us?

To make long story short, an american mathematician John Larry Kelly, Jr. (1923-1965)
calculated this and solution was so elegant and useful that we can now apply it to many things
where gain is bigger than the given chances would otherwise allow.
The equation says that optimum invest amount (U) equals odds (k) multiplied by chances (s)
minus one, all divided by odds minus one. U = (k*s-1) / (k-1)
So in our example where chances (s) were 50% (coin toss) and odds (k) were 2.10 (that is
decimal format for american moneyline +110, or UK 11/10) the optimum invest amount would be
U = (2.10 * 0.50 - 1) / (2.10 - 1)
U = 0.045, meaning that 4.5% of your Bank, at the time of placing bet, is the optimum invest
amount for achieving maximum profit.
Of course, all that was correct in given example, for different parameters it will give different
outputs.
One more thing, sometimes it is hard to say what are the correct chances for someone to win
the game or something alike. So, chances are the parameter - to which we must approach with
caution and always take the smaller value instead of the bigger one, if we are not sure.

Also it would be a great mistake to invest more than Kelly recommends, but investing less -
would just made us less money..

Second thing is choosing an appropriate system.
Imagine this: you play two tips a day, you guess 100% every time - what system would you
play? Accumulator (parlay) two out of two seams as the only logical system, it would be a big
mistake to play two singles instead. Why? Well, if you have $200.00 and you put $100.00 on first
and $100.00 on second (let them be +100, or decimal 2.00, or UK 1/1) you would have $400.00
but instead of that let say you played system 2/2 (doubles accumulator) - and invested $200.00
your winnings would then have been $800.00.
What if you guess the outcome in 99% of time? 98%? 97%? When does it become more
profitable to play singles?
Many people take for granted that playing singles is &quot;the only way&quot; to bet. As we have showed in
example - it is not always the most profitable. Calculating the most profitable system is hard job,
but it can be simply calculated by AdvancedBetCalc.com available free online.
Let me show you what I mean..
let say you found 8 games (american odds +100, dec. 2.00, UK 1/1) and you have 60% of
guessing that kind of odds in past plays.. Can you tell which system will bring back the highest
gain in long term?
Well, the answer is not easy to calculate, that is why we use calculator, answer is 2/8 and with
an invest of 76.8% of our Bank we would achieve maximum value of 1.173 times our bank per
system. Try to input your data and see your own potencial.
Maximization is great way to step over the line wich separates profit from lost.
Of course, bookies are offering to us odds based on mathematical calculus and &quot;other&quot; stuff like
instinct and the market law of supply and demand.. so it is an opportunity to extract profit if one
knows how. Best way to do so is if you can tell &quot;this odds are a gift considering chances..&quot; (value
bet) and then math again comes to the scene in shape of Kelly&#39;s criterion, mentioned above.
But if there were several games playing at the same time and all of them were &quot;value bets&quot; you
must use some serious math if you want to extract maximum money out from the situation..

Example:
8 games starts simultaneously, they are all &quot;coin toss winner - probability&quot; in your opinion - but
bookie gives +150 on each.
What do you do? Play singles?..
I don&#39;t expect that people will know the correct answer, maybe some will instinctively say &quot;no,
singles are too small for this..&quot;, but honestly I think that less then one out of million knows the
calculus procedure for finding the right result.
That is why I recomend use of AdvancedBetCalc.com for all those millions who don&#39;t know how
to calculate that with ease. We are leaving a lot of money to bookies, whether we were winners
or loosers last time we gambled.. ..whether we lost - or we failed to monetize our knowledge of
sports..

Example:
We have 5 games to wager on. They all play at different time. All even odds (+100, or 2.00, or
1/1) and we think that we have good chance to win some money by using a &quot;chase&quot; principle.
(&quot;Chase&quot; is type of betting where we increase the invest amount every time we lose and start
from beginning after every win.)
Well, the answer is: no, we don&#39;t have good chances. We have average chances, actually, in the
long terms, the same chances for losing our money - as to win any. Notice that it is the same
situation that we have when we play only one game. So, why waste time x5?
But don&#39;t get scared and believe that &quot;the chase is a dangerous and unknown road&quot;, it is not
unknown - the thing about it is - we know where it leads, it leads to zero. Eventually you lose,
bad luck streak catches you and you lose all winnings and end up in zero, as you would if you
have played singles, with even odds and matching chances. &quot;Chase&quot; is an illusion and winning
long term in that mode can be achieved only if you pick winners above expectations.
But, if you do pick winners more often than the average player, you have real chance to be a
successful bettor.
And then, it is so important to use any tool that will give you the edge over bookies, especially in
terms of an invest size and accumulator systems.
By using math you could calculate gain achieved by using chase and the one achieved when
some real science was used. If I go deeper in calculus, then my promise about 6th graders
understanding this, will be broken.. so for now this will have to do.
And &quot;chase&quot; vs &quot;real math&quot; will have to become &quot;well known fact that math rules any time..&quot;
So, how about it?
It is known to me that too many people (among which are many good players) stay way below
their potential, just because they choose wrong system for their good picks and also the wrong
invest amount..

But can it be so simple?
To take some historical data and say: I&#39;ve been guessing this (+110, or 2.10, or 11/10) odds in
58% throughout last year (or last let&#39;s say 600 games..) so now all I have to do with this 6 picks
is to - play this system (2/6), with invest amount of 58.5%.. to achieve theoretical maximum.. and
extract every and last coin that belongs to me..
In my opinion, yes. Because just look the alternative.. The alternative is chaos, or misleading by
thinking that &quot;facts&quot; are true facts - without really calculating them.
Check your options every time before placing a bet, that is why you have this calculator with
&quot;Best System Table&quot; for. And please stop leaving your money with bookies.
